`Energy` Measure the capacity to do work. Energy is measure in `joules`.
`Power` Is the rate at which work is done. Power is measure in `joules per second`.

> A watt (W) = 1 joule / second

As an example, a TV that has a rated power of 150W, will need 150 watts to work. If you use the TV for 3 hours, then you will have a consume power (P) = 150W x 3Hours = 450W/H.
