- we are having issues creating the concerto user in VPP v2.33.14
	- Use Security.User.Store
- if we are deploying to staging and prod we should use 2 different CES credentials
- Should we save concerto credentials also in the Delinea share folder?
- Datadog wasnt configure in AWS to forward adapter logs

- Divya is forgetting to check if the adapter is receiving kds records before uncomission multitenant


- While we wre deploying de adapter there was another parallel action to upgrade Concerto to v.2.36 and dpeloyment of leap



- add comment to the ticket why we are rolling back
